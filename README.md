Data and code for manuscript: Wildfire influences species assemblage and habitat utilisation of boreal wildlife after more than a decade in northern Sweden.

<b>Abstract</b>

Fires can strongly change the vegetation structure and the availability of resources for wildlife, but fire suppression has long affected the natural role of fire in shaping boreal ecosystems in northern Europe. Recently, wildfires have increased in frequency, possibly due to global warming. In contrast to the boreal systems in North America, there have been few studies on responses of wildlife to wildfires in northern Europe. Based on the findings from North America, we predict that responses of wildlife to wildfire vary among wildlife species: where mammalian herbivores, such as moose (<i>Alces alces</i>) and mountain hare (<i>Lepus timidus</i>), will be attracted to burnt areas following an increase in food availability, other species, such as reindeer (<i>Rangifer tarandus</i>), are negatively impacted due to fire reducing their preferred food. We then tested our predictions by contrasting wildlife utilization of sites that burnt by wildfire in 2006 with nearby unburnt control sites in three areas in northern Sweden. To measure wildlife utilization, we used 72 camera traps, equally divided between the burnt and control sites, with two placement strategies: random and on wildlife trails. The cameras recorded 27 mammal and bird species during summer 2018. Species assemblage differed between burnt and control sites. Fieldfare (<i>Turdus pilaris</i>) used burnt sites more than control sites, while pine marten (<i>Martes martes</i>) and western capercaillie (<i>Tetrao urogallus</i>) used control sites more than burnt sites. We however did not find support for a positive effect of past forest fires on any of the observed wild mammals. We discuss how, due to the impact of forestry, forage-rich habitat may not be as limiting in Scandinavia as in the North-American context, potentially leading to recently burnt sites being less attractive to herbivores such as moose.

<b>Description</b>
The Wildfire-Data.RData file contains a list with two data frames and a matrix: "species.observations" is a data frame which contains the number of observations of each species per camera-trap location, "covariates" is a data frame which contains the covariate data per camera-trap location, and "offset" is a matrix which contains the offset used in the analyses as a combination of species and location specific Effective Detection Distance and the number of days each camera was active. All annotated code for the analyses using ManyGLM are given in ManyGLM.R
